Signmykey is an automated SSH Certificate Authority. It allows you to securly and centraly manage SSH accesses to your infrastructure.

Three types of backends are supported by Signmykey:

* **Authorization**: users can be authentified through different systems like LDAP, Local map or Hashicorp Vault.
* **Principals**: list of principals applied to SSH certificates can be created dynamically from LDAP groups or setted staticaly in local config.
* **Signer**: cryptographic signing operations of SSH certificates can be done directly by Signmykey or via Hashicorp Vault.

## Quickstart

* Download Signmykey binary:
```
curl -LO https://github.com/signmykeyio/signmykey/releases/download/0.1.0/signmykey && chmod +x signmykey
```

* Start server in dev mode (replace *myremoteuser* by the name of the user you want to connect on remote server):
```
./signmykey server dev -u myremoteuser
```

* Follow "Server side" instructions displayed by previous command, ex:
```
### Server side                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                       
An ephemeral certificate authority is created for this instance and will die with it.                                                                                                  
To deploy this CA on destination servers, you can launch this command:                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
        $ echo "ssh-rsa fakeCApubKey" > /etc/ssh/ca.pub

You then have to add this line to "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" and restart OpenSSH server:

        TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/ca.pub
```

* Follow "Client side" instructions, ex:
```
### Client side

A temporary user is created with this parameters:

        user: myremoteuser
        password: fakepassword
        principals: myremoteuser

You can sign your key with this command:

        $ signmykey -a http://127.0.0.1:9600/ -u myremoteuser
```

* Congrats \o/
